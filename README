Initial version of Spring-Social binding for Mixcloud checked in. 

Authentication flow completed with basic profile operations and abstract classes to allow other API operations
to be added easily.

Current implementation allows Mixcloud profile data to be pulled into  Spring Social framework.  
Still to do, flush out user profile so it includes images etc and add other API operations
